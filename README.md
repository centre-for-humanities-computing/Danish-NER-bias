# Detecting intersectionality in NER models: A data-driven approach

This repository contains the code used to produce the results in the paper "**Detecting intersectionality in NER models: A data-driven approach**" by Lassen et al. (2023). 

The project investigates the effect of intersectional biases in several Danish models used for Named Entity Recognition (NER). Concretely, this is achieved by
